### Run tests

- Run 'meteor npm install' in the root and tests folder.
- Execute `run_tests.sh`, which links
  angular-meteor NPM in the root to avoid re-installing
  each time you re-build it.
- Make sure to rename node_modules to .node_modules
  in the root  since meteor can fail when there is
  a sub node_modules.
