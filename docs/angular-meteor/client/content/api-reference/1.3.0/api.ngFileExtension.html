# .ng.js and .ng.html files

----

> Since version 1.2.0 and above, the default behaviour with is using Angular compilation for regular `html` and `js` files.

> You just need to `meteor remove blaze-html-templates ecmascript`

> So [ng-annotate](https://github.com/olov/ng-annotate) and [angular-babel](https://github.com/pbastowski/angular-meteor-babel/) is activated by default for all `js` files and [$templateCache](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$templateCache) by default for all `html` files.

> If you want to keep using Blaze with Angular you should use the `angular-with-blaze` package instead of the `angular` package, don't remove `blaze-html-templates` and keep reading this file about `.ng.js` and `ng.html`

## ng-annotate and .ng.js

If you want to avoid minification problems with Angular's [dependency annotations](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di#dependency-annotation), you normally need to use a syntax that you're probably already familiar with:

    angular.module('socially').controller('PartiesListCtrl', ['$scope',
      function($scope){
        // ...
    }]);

There is a very popular Angular tool called [ng-annotate](https://github.com/olov/ng-annotate) that automatically adds and removes AngularJS dependency injection annotations. Angular-meteor uses that process automatically. All you need to do is to change your `.js` files to end with `.ng.js`. Those files will be recognised by Angular-meteor and automatically corrected, so you can simply write your dependency injection like this:

    angular.module('socially').controller('PartiesListCtrl',
      function($scope){
        // ...
    });

## AngularJS templates: .ng.html

Both [Blaze](https://www.meteor.com/blaze) (Meteor's templating system) and AngularJS use the same braces or 'double curley brackets' syntax for expressions. That causes issues when you're working with AngularJS in Meteor: Blaze will compile and override your AngularJS expression. To disable that behaviour, you can use the `.ng.html` file extension.
