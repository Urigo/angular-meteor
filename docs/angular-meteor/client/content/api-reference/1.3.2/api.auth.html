<a class="src-code" href="https://github.com/Urigo/angular-meteor/blob/master/packages/angular-meteor-auth/modules/auth.js" target="_blank">

`$auth` service is a part of `angular-meteor-auth` package, and it located inside `angular-meteor.auth` AngularJS module.

This service provides the functionality for authentication for your app.

`$auth` wraps Meteor's API for ease of use with AngularJS applications, and also provides the ability to access Meteor's Accounts package from the UI.

In order to use this service, you will need to add the package to your project and add it's module as a dependency to your AngularJS app:

    meteor add angular-meteor-auth
    
    angular.module('myApp', [
       'angular-meteor',
       'angular-meteor.auth'
    ]);

## API Reference

### waitForUser()

`waitForUser` is a method of `$auth` which waits for any user to log in.

It a wrapper for `Meteor.loggingIn` method, but it's return value is a promise which can be only resolved, when any user is done with the login process.

It is useful when you want to run part of your code only after the user logs in.

#### Usage example

    angular.module('myApp').directive('myComponent', function() {
      return {
        link: function($auth) {
          $auth.waitForUser().then(() => {
            // Login is done!
          });
        }
      };
    });


### requireUser()

`requireUser` provides a useful functionality for performing a one-time login check, with a promise.

It's very useful for `angular-ui-router`'s [resolve](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki#resolve) functionality.

It's return value is a promise, which resolves when the login process is done, and the `Meteor.user()` is valid and not `null`.

#### Usage example with angular-ui-router:

    $stateProvider
        .state({
            template: '<my-component></my-component>',
            resolve: {
              user: ($auth) => {
                return $auth.requireUser();
              }
            }
        });

### requireValidUser(validationMethod)

`requireValidUser` uses `requireUser` method, but adding another custom check that provided by the user.

It's return value is a promise, which resolves if the user is logged in and the custom validation method returns `true`.

If the user validation message returns anything other than `true`, the promise will rejected and the promise failure argument will be the return value of the validation message.

#### Usage example with angular-ui-router:

In this example, we will allow only logged in users, with `firstName` equals to `Uri`.

    $stateProvider
      .state({
        template: '<my-component></my-component>',
        resolve: {
          user: ($auth) => {
            return $auth.requireValidUser((user) => {);
              if (user.firstName === 'Uri') {
                return true;
              }
              else {
                return 'You are not Uri!';
              }
            }
          }
        }
      });

`$auth` service also provides two useful properties that are useful in views:

### currentUser

`$auth.currentUser` is a property of the `$auth` service, which contain the current logged in user in every time.

It automatically changes when the user logs in or logs out, and it can be used from the view or the AngularJS controller/components.

It's very useful for hiding / showing parts of the view depending on the login status.

#### Usage example inside a view

    <div ng-show="$auth.currentUser">I am visible only for logged in users!</div>
    <div ng-hide="$auth.currentUser">I am visible only for guests!</div>

#### Usage example inside a component

    angular.module('myApp').directive('myComponent', function() {
      return {
        link: function($auth) {
          $auth.waitForUser().then(() => {
            let currentUser = $auth.currentUser;
          });
        }
      };
    });

### loggingIn

`$auth.loggingIn` is a property of the `$auth` service, which contain the current login status.

It's a wrapper for [Meteor.loggingIn](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/meteor_loggingin) method.

It's value is `true` if a login method (such as `Meteor.loginWithPassword`, `Meteor.loginWithFacebook`, or `Accounts.createUser`) is currently in progress.

> You can use this property in your view in order to display a spinner or a "Logging you in..." message!

#### Usage example inside a view

    <div ng-show="$auth.loggingIn">Logging in...</div>
    <div ng-show="$auth.currentUser">I am visible only for logged in users!</div>
    <div ng-hide="$auth.currentUser">I am visible only for guests!</div>
