# Socially Meteor-Angular Tutorial App

The purpose of this tutorial is to start from the beginning of writing applications with Meteor and AngularJS. We will try to take the best tutorials of the 2 frameworks and combine them into one broad tutorial.

We believe that following the steps of this tutorial will be good for you whether you do or don't have previous knowledge in either Angular or Meteor.

This tutorial will walk you through building of an Angular-Meteor app. You will build a list of friends, that you can filter, dive into their profiles for more details and - of course - store it all on a server and sync the information between clients with different users in real time.

It will show you how AngularJS makes the browser smarter, while making your application code smaller and easier.

It will also show you how powerful Meteor is, with it's powerful data synchronization and latency compensation.

We will also tap into the huge eco-systems of each of those frameworks that will allow us to write quality applications in a fraction of the time.

Our goal in this tutorial is to add more steps as we go along, to cover as many use cases as possible, so if there
is a use case you are missing here, please suggest it on our [Github issues page](https://github.com/Urigo/angular-meteor/issues).

We also welcome pull requests for new chapters, we would love to work with you on them!

Enjoy!
