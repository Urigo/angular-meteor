# Angular-Meteor Manifesto

### Donâ€™t choose one solution

We created this library so you can use **both Blaze and AngularJS** in the same application and even on the same page, template or directive.

* You can start with AngularJS and migrate your application slowly to Blaze.
* You can start using Blaze and move slowly to AngularJS.
* You can use both of them together forever.

### A combined power

Use libraries, packages and solutions from both communities.

### Neutrality

We are here to give neutral perspective on the two frameworks.
