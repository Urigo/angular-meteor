In this step, we will implement the party details view, which is displayed when a user clicks on a party in the parties list.
The user will also be able to change the party's details.

To implement the party details view we will use [$meteor.object](/api/meteorObject) to fetch our data, and update it back in realtime when the user changes it.

# Controller

We'll expand the `PartyDetailsCtrl` by using the [$meteor.object](/api/meteorObject) service (add it with Angular's dependency injection) to bind the specific party:

    angular.module('socially').controller('PartyDetailsCtrl', ['$scope', '$stateParams', '$meteor',
      function($scope, $stateParams, $meteor){

        $scope.party = $meteor.object(Parties, $stateParams.partyId);

    }]);

We are sending $meteor.object a Mongo collection and the Id of the object we want to bind to.

$meteor.object returns an [AngularMeteorObject](/api/meteorObject) that contains the data.

$meteor.object accepts a selector as the second argument.

That selector can be a Mongo Selector, Object ID, or String.

In our example we used the Object's ID but it can also come in the form of `{field: query}`.

$meteor.object will find the first document that matches the selector,
as directed by the sort and skip options, exactly like Meteor's [collection.findOne](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/findone)


# Template

In `party-details.ng.html` let's replace the binding to the `partyId` with a binding to `party.name` and `party.description`:

    Here you will see and change the details of the party:

    <input ng-model="party.name">
    <input ng-model="party.description">


Now, when you run the app, navigate into a party's page, and change the inputs, the server and all the clients update immediately.
No save buttons, no round trips, it just works.

# Classic Save and Cancel buttons

In case you don't want to use the live editing that angular-meteor provides and want to present to your users a classic "Save" "Cancel" form, you can do that as well.

First, let's change our template:

__party-details.ng.html__


    Here you will see and change the details of the party:

    <input ng-model="party.name">
    <input ng-model="party.description">

    <button ng-click="save()">Save</button>
    <button ng-click="reset()">Reset form</button>
    <button ui-sref="parties">Cancel</button>



Now let's move to the controller.

First, in the call to `$meteor.object` set the 3rd parameter to `false` so it won't auto-save the object on every change:


    $scope.party = $meteor.object(Parties, $stateParams.partyId, false);


Now let's add the functions that handle the button clicks:

    $scope.save = function() {
      $scope.party.save();
    };

    $scope.reset = function() {
      $scope.party.reset();
    };


As you can see, $meteor.object returns an object from type [AngularMeteorObject](/api/meteorObject) which contains 2 functions - `save` and `reset`.

**save()** - saves the current value of the object to the server.
**reset()** - resets the current value of the object from the server.

Your controller should look like this:

    angular.module('socially').controller('PartyDetailsCtrl', ['$scope', '$stateParams', '$meteor',
      function($scope, $stateParams, $meteor){

        $scope.party = $meteor.object(Parties, $stateParams.partyId, false);

        $scope.save = function() {
          $scope.party.save().then(function(numberOfDocs){
            console.log('save success doc affected ', numberOfDocs);
          }, function(error){
            console.log('save error', error);
          });
        };

        $scope.reset = function() {
          $scope.party.reset();
        };

    }]);

That's it!

Simple and easy.


# Summary

We've seen the power of 3-way binding between the DOM, AngularJS and Meteor.  In collections and in objects.

Let's move on to provide some order and structure in our application.
