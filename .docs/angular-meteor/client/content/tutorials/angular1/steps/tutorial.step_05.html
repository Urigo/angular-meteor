In this step, you will learn how to create a layout template and how to build an app that has multiple views by adding routing, using an Angular module called `ui-router`.

The goals for this step:

* When you navigate to `index.html`, you will be redirected to `index.ng.html/parties` and the party list should appear in the browser.
* When you click on a party link the URL should change to one specific to that party and the stub of a party detail page is displayed.

# Dependencies

The routing functionality added by this step is provided by the [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) module, which is distributed separately from the core Angular framework.

We will install ui-router with the help of [the official Meteor package](https://atmospherejs.com/angularui/angular-ui-router).

Type in the command line:

    meteor add angularui:angular-ui-router

Then add the ui-router as a dependency to our angular app in `app.js`:

    angular.module('socially',['angular-meteor', 'ui.router']);


# Multiple Views, Routing and Layout Template

Our app is slowly growing and becoming more complex.
Until now, the app provided our users with a single view (the list of all parties), and all of the template code was located in the `index.ng.html` file.

The next step in building the app is to add a view that will show detailed information about each of the parties in our list.

To add the detailed view, we could expand the `index.ng.html` file to contain template code for both views, but that would get messy very quickly.

Instead, we are going to turn the `index.html` template into what we call a "layout template". This is a template that is common for all views in our application.
Other "partial templates" are then included into this layout template depending on the current "route" — the view that is currently displayed to the user.

Application routes in Angular are declared via the [$stateProvider](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki), which is the provider of the $state service.
This service makes it easy to wire together controllers, view templates, and the current URL location in the browser.
Using this feature we can implement deep linking, which lets us utilize the browser's history (back and forward navigation) and bookmarks.


# Template

The $state service is normally used in conjunction with the uiView directive.
The role of the uiView directive is to include the view template for the current route into the layout template.
This makes it a perfect fit for our `index.ng.html` template.

Let's create a new html file called `parties-list.ng.html` and paste the existing list code from `index.ng.html` into it:

__`parties-list.ng.html`:__

    <form>
      <label>Name</label>
      <input ng-model="newParty.name">
      <label>Description</label>
      <input ng-model="newParty.description">
      <button ng-click="parties.push(newParty)">Add</button>
    </form>
    <ul>
      <li ng-repeat="party in parties">
        <a href="/parties/{{dstache}}party._id}}">{{dstache}}party.name}}</a>

        <p>{{dstache}}party.description}}</p>
        <button ng-click="remove(party)">X</button>
      </li>
    </ul>


The code is almost the same except for this one change:

- Added a link to the parties name display (that link will take us to that party's detailed page)

Now let's go back to `index.html` and replace the content with the `ui-view` directive:

__`index.html`:__

    <head>
      <base href="/">
    </head>
    <body ng-app="socially">

    <div>
      <h1>
        <a href="/parties">Home</a>
      </h1>
      <div ui-view></div>
    </div>

    </body>

Notice we did 3 things:

1. Replaced all the content with ui-view (this will be responsible for including the right content according to the current URL).
2. Added a `h1` header with a link to the main parties page.
3. We also added a `base` tag in the head (required when using HTML5 location mode).

Now we can delete the `index.ng.html` file, it's not used any more.

Let's add a placeholder to the new party details page.
Create a new html file called `party-details.ng.html` and paste in the following code:

__`party-details.ng.html`:__

    Here you will see the details of party number: {{dstache}} partyId }}


This code can serve as a placeholder for now. We'll get back to filling out the details later on.


# Routes definition

Now let's configure our routes.
Add this config code in `app.js`, after the Angular app has been defined:

    angular.module('socially').config(['$urlRouterProvider', '$stateProvider', '$locationProvider',
      function($urlRouterProvider, $stateProvider, $locationProvider){

        $locationProvider.html5Mode(true);

        $stateProvider
          .state('parties', {
            url: '/parties',
            templateUrl: 'parties-list.ng.html',
            controller: 'PartiesListCtrl'
          })
          .state('partyDetails', {
            url: '/parties/:partyId',
            templateUrl: 'party-details.ng.html',
            controller: 'PartyDetailsCtrl'
          });

          $urlRouterProvider.otherwise('/parties');
    }]);


Using the Angular app's .config() method, we request the `$stateProvider` to be injected into our config function and use the state method to define our routes.

Our application routes are defined as follows:

* **('/parties')**: The parties list view will be shown when the URL hash fragment is /parties. To construct this view, Angular will use the parties-list.ng.html template and the PartiesListCtrl controller.
* **('/parties/:partyId')**: The party details view will be shown when the URL hash fragment matches '/parties/:partyId', where :partyId is a variable part of the URL. To construct the party details view, Angular will use the party-details.ng.html template and the PartyDetailsCtrl controller.
* **$urlRouterProvider.otherwise('/parties')**: Triggers a redirection to /parties when the browser address doesn't match either of our routes.
* **$locationProvider.html5Mode(true)**: Sets the URL to look like a regular one. more about it [here](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/$location#hashbang-and-html5-modes).
* Each template gets loaded by it's **absolute path** to the project's top folder ('party-details.ng.html').  this is done by angular-meteor's build process which loads the templates into a cache and names them according to their paths.
If the templates are coming from a package, they will get a prefix of the package name like so - 'my-app_my-package_client/views/my-template.ng.html'.
You can read more about the templating build process in [our code](https://github.com/Urigo/angular-meteor/blob/master/plugin/handler.js).

Note the use of the `:partyId` parameter in the second route declaration.
The $state service uses the route declaration — `/parties/:partyId` — as a template that is matched against the current URL.
All variables defined with the : notation are extracted into the $stateParams object.

# Controllers

As you might have seen we removed the controller definition from the ng-controller directive in the `index.ng.html` and moved it into the routes definitions.

But we still need to define our `PartyDetailsCtrl` controller.
Add this code under the existing controller:

    angular.module("socially").controller("PartyDetailsCtrl", ['$scope', '$stateParams',
      function($scope, $stateParams){

        $scope.partyId = $stateParams.partyId;

    }]);


Now all is in place.  Run the app and you'll notice a few things:

* Click on the link in the name of a party - notice that you moved into a different view and that the party's id appears in both the browser's url and in the template.
* Click back - you are back to the main list. this is because of ui-router's integration with the browser's history.
* Try to put arbitrary text in the URL - something like http://localhost:3000/strange-url.  You should to be automatically redirected to the main parties list.


#### Common Mistakes

If you haven't entered the correct absolute path when defining the routes (e.g. by accident adding a relative one), then you might get the following error:

WARNING: Tried to load angular more than once.

If that's the case, double check your paths and remember to use the file extension `.ng.html`.


# Summary

With the routing set up and the parties list view implemented, we're ready to go to the next step and implement the party details view.
