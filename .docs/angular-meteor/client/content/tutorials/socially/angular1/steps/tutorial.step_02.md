It's time to make our web app dynamic â€” with Angular 1.

This step is focused on client side Angular 1 tools. The next one will show you the power of Meteor.

# View and Template

In Angular 1, the view is a projection of the model through the HTML template. This means that whenever the model changes, Angular 1 refreshes the appropriate binding points, which updates the view.

Let's change our template to be dynamic:

{{> DiffBox tutorialName="meteor-angular1-socially" step="2.1"}}

We replaced the hard-coded party list with the [ngRepeat](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngRepeat) directive and two Angular 1 expressions:

* The `ng-repeat="party in parties"` attribute in the `li` tag is an Angular 1 repeater directive. The repeater tells Angular 1 to create a `li` element for each party in the list using the `li` tag as the template.
* The expressions wrapped in double-curly-braces ( `{{dstache}}party.name}}` and `{{dstache}}party.description}}` ) will be replaced by the value of the expressions.

We have added a new directive, called `ng-controller`, which attaches the `PartiesListCtrl` controller to the `div` tag. At this point *the expressions in double-curly-braces are referring to our application model, which is set up in our `PartiesListCtrl` controller.*


# Model and Controller

To create our controller and model we start with `PartiesListCtrl` controller and place data in it.

We declared a controller called `PartiesListCtrl` and registered it in our Angular 1 module app - `socially`.

The data model is now instantiated within the `PartiesListCtrl` controller.

Although the controller is not yet doing very much, it plays a crucial role. By providing context for our data model, the controller allows us to establish data-binding between the model and the view. We connected the dots between the presentation, the data, and the logic components as follows:

* The ngController directive, located on the `div` tag, references the name of our controller, `PartiesListCtrl` (located in the JavaScript file `app.js`).
* The `PartiesListCtrl` controller attaches the party data to the `$scope` that was injected into our controller function. This controller scope is available to all bindings located within the `div ng-controller="PartiesListCtrl">` tag.

# ng-annotate and .ng.js

As you can see, when we declared the controller, we used strings for [dependency annotations](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di#dependency-annotation) that avoids minification problems:

    angular.module('socially').controller('PartiesListCtrl', ['$scope',
      function($scope){
        // ...
    }]);

There is a very popular Angular 1 tool that's called [ng-annotate](https://github.com/olov/ng-annotate) that takes care of that for us so we can write regular code that won't get mangled in minification.

angular-meteor uses that process automatically. All you need to do is to change your `.js` files to end with `.ng.js`

So let's change `app.js` to `app.ng.js` and change the usage in our controller:

And from now on, each Angular 1 file we will create will use the `ng.js` extension!

# Summary

You now have a dynamic app that features separate model, view and controller components.

But, this is all client side, which is nice for tutorials, but in a real application we need to persist the data on the server and sync all the clients with it.
