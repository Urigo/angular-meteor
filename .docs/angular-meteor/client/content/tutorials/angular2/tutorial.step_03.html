OK, so we have a nice client side application that creates and renders it's own data.

So, if we were in any framework other than Meteor, we would start implementing a series of REST endpoints to connect the server to the client.
Also, we would need to create a database and functions to connect to it.

And we haven't talked about realtime, in which case we would need to add sockets, and a local DB for cache and handle latency compensation (or just ignore those features and create a not - so - good and modern app...)

But luckily, we use Meteor!


Meteor makes writing distributed client code as simple as talking to a local database.

Every Meteor client includes an in-memory database cache. To manage the client cache, the server publishes sets of JSON documents, and the client subscribes to these sets. As documents in a set change, the server patches each client's cache automatically.

That introduce us to a new concept - **Full Stack Reactivity**.

In an Angularish language we might call it **3 way data binding**.

The way to handle data in Meteor is through the `Mongo.Collection` class. It is used to declare MongoDB collections and to manipulate them.

Thanks to minimongo, Meteor's client-side Mongo emulator, `Mongo.Collection` can be used from both client and server code.

# Declare a collection

So first, let's define our first parties collection that will store all our parties.

Add:

    Parties = new Mongo.Collection("parties");

to the beginning of the `app.ts` file.

Notice that this code runs outside of the `isClient` statement.

That means that this collection and the actions on it will run both on the client (minimongo) and the server (Mongo), you only have to write it once, and Meteor will take care of syncing both of them.

# Binding to Angular

Now that we've created the collection, our client needs to subscribe to it's changes and bind it to our parties Angular array.

To bind them we will simply reference the parties in the constructor, then call fetch to retrieve them.

    constructor() {
      this.parties = Parties.find().fetch();
    }

But what happens if the parties data changes on the server-side? How can we tell parties to update itself?

For now, we can use Meteor [Tracker](https://www.meteor.com/tracker), a reactive wrapper that we will run data when a change occurs. We will bind it to Angular's change detection system, [Zone.js](https://github.com/angular/zone.js).

    Tracker.autorun(zone.bind(() => {
      this.parties = Parties.find().fetch();
    }));

Our `app.ts` file should look like this:

__`app.ts`:__

    Parties = new Mongo.Collection("parties");

    if (Meteor.isClient) {
      import {Component, View, NgFor, bootstrap} from 'angular2/angular2';

      @Component({
        selector: 'app'
      })
      @View({
        templateUrl: "index.ng.html",
        directives: [NgFor]
      })
      class Socially {
        constructor () {
          Tracker.autorun(zone.bind(() => {
            this.parties = Parties.find().fetch();
          }));
        }
      }

      bootstrap(Socially);
    }

Now every change what happens to the `this.parties` variable will automatically be saved to the local minimongo DB and synced to the MongoDB server DB and all the other clients in realtime!

But we still don't have data in that collection, so let's add some.
Let's initialize our server with the same parties we had before.

Add this to the bottom of `app.ts`:

    if (Meteor.isServer) {
      Meteor.startup(function () {
        if (Parties.find().count() === 0) {

        var parties = [
          {'name': 'Dubstep-Free Zone',
          'description': 'Can we please just for an evening not listen to dubstep.'},
          {'name': 'All dubstep all the time',
          'description': 'Get it on!'},
          {'name': 'Savage lounging',
          'description': 'Leisure suit required. And only fiercest manners.'}
        ];

        for (var i = 0; i < parties.length; i++)
          Parties.insert(parties[i]);
        }
      });
    }

As you can probably understand, this code runs only on the server, and when Meteor starts it initializes the DB with these sample parties.

Run the app and you should see the list of parties on the screen.

In the next chapter we will see how easy it is to manipulate the data, save and publish changes to the server, and by doing so, all the connected clients will automatically get updated.

# Inserting parties from the console

Items inside collections are called documents. Let's use the server database console to insert some documents into our collection.
In a new terminal tab, go to your app directory and type:

    meteor mongo

This opens a console into your app's local development database. At the prompt, type:

    db.parties.insert({ name: "A new party", description: "From the mongo console!" });

In your web browser, you will see the UI of your app immediately update to show the new party.
You can see that we didn't have to write any code to connect the server-side database to our front-end code — it just happened automatically.

Insert a few more parties from the database console with different text.

Now let's do the same but with remove. At the prompt, type the following command to look at all the parties and their properties:

    db.parties.find({});

Now choose one party you want to remove and copy it's id property.
Then, remove it using that id (replace N4KzMEvtm4dYvk2TF with your party's id value):

    db.parties.remove( {"_id": "N4KzMEvtm4dYvk2TF"});

Again, you will see the UI of your app immediately update with that party removed.

Try running more actions like updating an object from the console and so on.

In the next step, we'll see how to add functionality to our app's UI so that we can add parties without using the database console.


# Summary

In this chapter you saw how easy and fast it is to create a full connection between our client data, the server and all the other connected clients.
