OK, so we have a working app, but, like a tutorial, it's not well organized.

It is really important to organize your app in a standard way, and in Meteor, the structure itself has meaning and implications.

In this step, we are going to combine Meteor's and Angular's standard ways of structuring an app into one unified standard structure.



# Meteor folder structure

From the `docs.meteor.com` site:

> A Meteor application is a mix of JavaScript that runs inside a client web browser, JavaScript that runs on the Meteor server inside a Node.js container, and all the supporting HTML fragments, CSS rules, and static assets.
> Meteor automates the packaging and transmission of these different components. And, it is quite flexible about how you choose to structure those components in your file tree.
>
> Files outside the **client**, **server** and **tests** subdirectories are loaded on both the client and the server!
> That's the place for model definitions and other functions.
>
> CSS files are gathered together as well: the client will get a bundle with all the CSS in your tree (excluding the server, public, and private subdirectories).
>
> In development mode, JavaScript and CSS files are sent individually to make debugging easier.

## Load order

It is best to write your application in such a way that it is insensitive to the order in which files are loaded. This can be achieved by using, for example, Meteor.startup or by moving load order sensitive code into packages, which can explicitly control both the load order of their contents and their load order with respect to other packages.
However, sometimes load order dependencies in your application are unavoidable.

The JavaScript and CSS files in an application are loaded according to these rules:

### server

Meteor gathers any files under the **private** subdirectory and makes the contents of these files available to server code via the Assets API. The **private** subdirectory is the place for any files that should be accessible to server code but not served to the client, like private data files.

Any sensitive code that you don't want served to the client, such as code containing passwords or authentication mechanisms, should be kept in the server directory.

### client

Files inside the **client** folder will run only on the client side.

There are more assets to consider on the client side. Meteor gathers all JavaScript files in your tree, with the exception of the server, public, and private subdirectories, for the client. It minifies this bundle and serves it to each new client. You're free to use a single JavaScript file for your entire application, or create a nested tree of separate files, or anything in between.


### public

Lastly, the Meteor server will serve any files under the public directory. This is the place for images, favicon.ico, robots.txt, and anything else.

### More rules

* Files in subdirectories are loaded before files in parent directories, so that files in the deepest subdirectory are loaded first, and files in the root directory are loaded last.
* Within a directory, files are loaded in alphabetical order by filename.
* After sorting as described above, all files under directories named **lib** are moved before everything else (preserving their order).
* Finally, all files that match main.* are moved after everything else (preserving their order).


# Angular folder structure

It makes sense to organize an Angular 2 app in components. These are the bits and pieces we use to construct our app.

Components go inside of other components, creating a tree-like structure. We can use this same pattern to organize our app.


# Re-structuring our app

So now let's re-structure our app (to see the end result and all the steps in git diff you can click [here](https://github.com/Urigo/meteor-angular-socially/compare/step_06...step_07)):

Add a folder called `client` and put all the `Meteor.isClient` code inside. You can now remove `Meteor.isClient` references.


1. Create a folder named `client` under the root folder.  This is where all the code inside `Meteor.isClient` will go (without the need of Meteor.isClient anymore)

    client
      \- index.html
      \- app.ts
      \- parties-list
          \- parties-list.ng.html
          \- parties-list.ts
      \- parties-form
          \- parties-form.ng.html
          \- parties-form.ts
      \- party-details
          \- party-details.ng.html
          \- party-details.ts

2. We are relying on ES6 imports, so loading order isn't as important. Basically we just load our bootstrapped app, and it grabs dependencies.
However, you must change all corresponding `templateUrl`'s in our `.ts` files to point to `client/path/to/file`

3. Don't forget to change the System.js path in your `index.html` file.

    `<script>System.import('client/app');</script>`

4. The parties Mongo collection needs to run on both client and server, so let's move it out of the `client` folder. Create a folder called `model` under the root folder. Inside create a file called `parties.ts` and cut this line from `app.ts` - `Parties = new Mongo.Collection("parties");` - and place it in `parties.ts`.

    client {...}
    model
      \- parties.ts

5. Create a `server` folder under the root folder. Everything inside that folder will run only on the server. Now create a folder called `startup` under the `server` folder and create a file called `loadParties.ts` under it. Now go to `app.ts`, cut all the code inside the `if (Meteor.isServer)` statement and place it inside the `loadParties.ts` file. Again, no need for the if statement anymore because all the code inside the `server` folder runs only on the server.

    client {...}
    model {...}
    server
        \- loadParties.ts


As you can see, everything is still working as before. Only now we have a cleaner separation of client, server and shared files.
