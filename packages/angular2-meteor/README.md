## Tutorial

If you are new to Angular2 and/or Meteor but want to learn them quickly, 
please check out our 23-steps Angular2-Meteor [tutorial](http://www.angular-meteor.com/tutorials/socially/angular2/bootstrapping).

## Questions and Issues

If you have rather a question than an issue, please consider the following resources at first:
- [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Urigo/angular-meteor)
- [Stack Overflow `angular2-meteor` tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/angular2-meteor)
- [Meteor forum](https://forums.meteor.com/c/angular)

The chances to get a quick response there is higher than posting a new issue here.

If you've decided that it's likely a real issue, please consider going through the following list at first:
- Check quickly recently [created](https://github.com/Urigo/angular2-meteor/issues)/[closed](https://github.com/Urigo/angular2-meteor/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) issues: chances are high that someone's already created a similar one
  or similar issue's been resolved;
- If your issue looks nontrivial, we would approciate a small demo to reproduce it.
  You will also get a response much faster.

## Quick Start

### Install package:

To install Angular2-Meteor's NPMs:
````
    npm install angular2-meteor --save
````

Second step is to add ` angular2-compilers` package â€” `meteor add angular2-compilers`.
This package adds custom HTML processor, LESS, SASS and TypeScript compilers.
Custom HTML processor and Style compilers make sure that static resources can be used
in the way that Angular 2 requires, and TypeScript is a recommended JS-superset to develop with Angular 2.

Please note that you'll have to remove the standard Meteor HTML processor (and LESS package).
The reason is that Meteor doesn't allow more than two processor for one extension:
````
   meteor remove blaze-html-templates
````

Angular 2 heavily relies on some polyfills (`zone.js`, `reflect-metadata` etc).
There are two ways to add them:
- Add `import 'angular2-meteor-polyfills'` at the top of every file that imports Angular 2;
- Add `barbatus:angular2-polyfills` package. Since it's a package, it's loaded by Meteor before any user code.

Please, don't forget to add a main HTML file (can be `index.html` or with any other name) even if your app template consists of one single tag,
e.g., `<body><app></app></body>`.

### Using Angular 2 in a Meteor app:

The package contains `MeteorModule` module that has providers simplifing development of a Meteor app with Angular 2.

You can use Meteor collections in the same way as you would do in a regular Meteor app with the Blaze,
the only thing required is to import and use `MeteorModule` from `angular2-meteor`.
After, you you can iterate `Mongo.Cursor` objects with Angular 2.0's `ngFor`!

Below is a valid Angular2-Meteor app:

````ts
    import {MeteorModule, MeteorComponent} from 'angular2-meteor';

    const Parties = new Mongo.Collection('parties');
    
    @Component({
      template: `
        <div *ngFor="let party of parties">
          <p>Name: {{party.name}}</p>
        </div>
      `
    })
    class Socially extends MeteorComponent {
        constructor() {
          this.subscribe('my-subscription');
          this.parties = Parties.find();
        }
    }

    @NgModule({
      imports: [BrowserModule, MeteorModule],
      declarations: [Socially],
      bootstrap: [Socially]
    })
    export class AppModule { }

    platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);
````

`MeteorComponent` wraps major Meteor methods to do some work behind the scene (such as cleanup) for a component that extends it.
You can read more about `MeteorComponent` in the [tutorial section] (http://www.angular-meteor.com/tutorials/socially/angular2/privacy-and-publish-subscribe-functions)!

At this moment, you are almost set to create awesome apps backed by the power of Angular 2 and Meteor!
We recommend to check out our awesome [tutorial](http://www.angular-meteor.com/tutorials/socially/angular2/bootstrapping) in order to create more complex apps that have security and routing.

## Demos

Check out two demos for the quick how-to:

* the Tutorial's [Socially app](https://github.com/Urigo/meteor-angular2.0-socially)
* Simple [Todos](https://github.com/Urigo/Meteor-Angular2/tree/master/examples/todos-meteor-1.3) demo

## Static Resources

Angular 2 allows to define a component's template and styles in two ways: using template content directly
or using template URL. We recommend to use template content directly.

For that purpose, `angular2-compilers`'s HTML, LESS, and SASS compilers process associated files and
add Node JS-modules that export string file contents outside.
After, one can import a template content in ES6 style:
```
  import template from  './foo.html';

  import style from './foo.less';
```

For more information, please check out [css-compiler](https://github.com/Urigo/angular2-meteor/tree/master/atmosphere-packages/css-compiler)
and [static-templates](https://github.com/Urigo/meteor-static-templates).

> To get rid of the `module './foo.html' not found` warnigns,
> run 
```
typings install github:meteor-typings/angular2-compilers#c2ca3d3036b08f04a22b98ed16ff17377499e1e7 --global
```

## TypeScript
The package uses [TypeScript for Meteor](https://github.com/barbatus/typescript) to compile (transpile) `.ts`-files.

TypeScript configuration file a.k.a. `tsconfig.json` is supported as well.

Please note that `tsconfig.json` is not required, but if you want to configure TypeScript
in your IDE or add more options, place `tsconfig.json` in the root folder of your app.
You can read about all available compiler options [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/tsconfig.json).

Default TypeScript options for Meteor 1.3 are as follows:
````json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "module": "commonjs",
    "target": "es5",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "sourceMap": true
  }
}
````

### Typings

To add declaration files of any global 3-party JavaScript library including Meteor itself (so called ambient typings), we recommend to use the [`typings`](https://github.com/typings/typings) utility, which is designed to search across and install typings from `DefinitelyTyped` and own typings registries.

For example, to install Meteor declaration file run:
````
npm install typings -g

typings install registry:env/meteor --global
````

For more information on Meteor typings, please read [here](https://github.com/meteor-typings/meteor).

Please note that you don't need to worry about Angular 2's typings and typings of the related NPMs!
TypeScript finds and checkes them in NPMs automatically.

## Babel

It's possibly to use Angular2 with Babel as a primary language.

To make development as convenient as it would be if you chose TypeScript,
there exist special Babel plugins. So you'll need to install them:

```
  npm i babel-plugin-angular2-annotations babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy babel-plugin-transform-class-properties babel-plugin-transform-flow-strip-types --save-dev
```

Then add `.babelrc` as follows:
```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "angular2-annotations",
    "transform-decorators-legacy",
    "transform-class-properties",
    "transform-flow-strip-types"
  ]
}
```
